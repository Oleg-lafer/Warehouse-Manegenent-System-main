# Smart Agricultural Warehouse System 🌱

This is a full-stack system for managing an agricultural warehouse using AI and embedded systems.

## 📦 Components

1. 📡 [Embedded System - Raspberry Pi + ESP32](https://github.com/Oleg-lafer/Automated-Inventory-Management-System-RaspberryPi-ESP32)  
   Integrates weight (HX711), temperature (DHT), and ultrasonic (HC-SR04) sensors with camera control and real-time image prediction.

2. 🧠 [Vegetable Classifier - CNN + TensorFlow](https://github.com/Oleg-lafer/Vegetable-Classifier-CNN-TensorFlow)  
   A deep learning model for classifying vegetables in images, using TensorFlow (InceptionV3) and OpenCV for preprocessing.

3. 🌐 [Warehouse Management Web App](https://github.com/Oleg-lafer/Warehouse-Manegenent-App)  
   A full-stack web interface for tracking vegetable inventory, visualizing sensor data, and managing warehouse operations.
