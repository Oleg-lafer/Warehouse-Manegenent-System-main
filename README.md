# Smart Agricultural Warehouse System 🌱

<small>
Smart warehouse system (agricultural) using Raspberry Pi and a camera to classify items (vegetables) in the warehouse through image classification with a CNN model we trained. The system runs on Linux and integrates embedded components such as ESP32 with C++ firmware, interfacing with sensors including HX711 (weight), DHT (temperature), and HC-SR04 (object detection), enabling synchronization and automation of warehouse operations through the database of the application system built with React and Node.js.

## 📦 System Components

1. 📡 [Embedded System - Raspberry Pi + ESP32](https://github.com/Oleg-lafer/Automated-Inventory-Management-System-RaspberryPi-ESP32)  
   Integrates weight (HX711), temperature (DHT), and ultrasonic (HC-SR04) sensors with camera control and real-time image prediction.

2. 🧠 [Vegetable Classifier - CNN + TensorFlow](https://github.com/Oleg-lafer/Vegetable-Classifier-CNN-TensorFlow)  
   A convolutional neural network model for classifying vegetables in images, using TensorFlow (InceptionV3) and OpenCV.

3. 🌐 [Warehouse Management Web App](https://github.com/Oleg-lafer/Warehouse-Manegenent-App)  
   A full-stack web interface for tracking inventory, monitoring sensor data, and managing operations.
